# 4-Cylinder Engine
A detailed model of a 4-cylinder internal combustion engine. This project demonstrates the working of a typical inline-4 engine, showcasing the piston movement, crankshaft rotation, valve operation, and overall engine cycle.

# Project Description
This project aims to simulate and/or model the internal functioning of a 4-cylinder engine, commonly used in automotive applications. The model includes key components such as:
- Pistons
- Crankshaft
- Camshaft
- Valves (intake and exhaust)
- Spark plugs
- Combustion cycle (Intake, Compression, Power, Exhaust)
# Features
- Realistic 4-stroke engine cycle simulation
- Synced crankshaft and camshaft rotation
- Valve timing control
- Visual representation of each engine stroke
- (Optional) Sound or animation effects
- (Optional) User interaction (e.g., start/stop engine)
Software : - SolidWorks 2024
